Question:
	Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: Sudoku Puzzles - The Rules.
	The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

	Note: A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.
Answer:

class Solution:
    # @param board, a 9x9 2D array
    # @return a boolean
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):
        row = [set()] * 9
        column = [set()] * 9
        square = [set()] * 9
        for i in range(0,9):
            for j in range(0, 9):
                if board[i][j] == '.':
                    continue
                if board[i][j] in row[i] or board[i][j] in column[j] or board[i][j] in square[(i/3)*3 + j/3]:
                    return False
                else:
                    row[i] = row[i] | {board[i][j]}
                    column[j] = column[j] | {board[i][j]}
                    square[(i/3)*3 + j/3] = square[(i/3)*3 + j/3] | {board[i][j]}
        return True
